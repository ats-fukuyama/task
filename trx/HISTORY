	The accuracy of the derivatives and the extrapolations are
          improved to include the Aitken-Neville method for inter- and
          extrapolation and the formula having the second-order accuracy
	  applied not only to the simple boundary conditions but also
          to the coefficients of the band matrix.
	The model of trapped partcle fraction is fixed, which is Kim
          model.
	The model of radial electric field is fixed, which is Waltz
          model.

	TASK/TR can implement one dimensional modelling tests of
	  the mean and the mean square deviations of the predictions
 	  for stored energies(AVERW, RW), and the standard 
	  deviations(STD) and offsets(OFF) for electron and ion
          (you can see details in Ncl. Fus. Vol.39, No.12 p2219-2222 
          (1999)).
	The procedure is the following:
	  1. Run TASK/TR.
	  2. Push the key of 'M' if it pauses then it writes out
	     pre-statistical analysis datafile named 
             '(device)(shot#).dat'.
	  3. Iterate this procedure until datafiles of each shot
 	     you'd like to survey are accumulated.
	  4. Implement perl script 'trstat' which gathers all files
  	     which have the extention names of 'dat' in a current
             directory then you can get 'stat_results' file.
	  5. Make a graph with, for instance, Kaleida graph or something
	     kind of that to read 'stat_results'.
	You can use perl script 'trclsf' if you'd like to put it into
	  sections in order to show an analysis graph topically.

	The NCLASS module is added, which calculates the neoclassical
	  transport properties of a multi-species axisymmetric plasma of
	  arbitrary aspect ratio, geometry and collisionality.
	The NCLASS module for TR consists of header file, trncls.inc, 
 	  subroutine file, trncls.f, and original files in "nclass"
	  directory.
	The NCLASS module calculate the following parameters.
	*****
	  Neoclassical plasma resistivity: ETA
	  Bootstrap current:               <J_bs.B> or coefficients
	  Heat conduction coefficients:    p'/p and T'/T
	  Diffusion coefficients:          p'/p and T'/T
	  Heat convection velocity:        <E.B>
	  Particle convection velocity:    <E.B>
	  Radial heat conduction flux components: 
		m=1, banana-plateau, p' and T'
		m=2, Pfirsch-Schluter
	 	m=3, classical
		m=4, banana-plateau, <E.B>
		m=5, banana-plateau, external parallel force
	  Radial particle flux components: 
		m=1, banana-plateau, p' and T'
		m=2, Pfirsch-Schluter
	 	m=3, classical
		m=4, banana-plateau, <E.B>
		m=5, banana-plateau, external parallel force
	*****
	We must compute a complete matrix of coefficients of n and T.
	Please note that NCLASS switch parameter, MDNCLS, is prioritized
	  over other its parameters like MDLETA, MDLAD, MDLJBS, MDLAVK, 
	  MDLKNC, CNC and so on.

	Sauter's approximate equations are added, which are neoclassical
	  conductivity and bootstrap current formulas for general 
	  axisymmetric equilibria and arbitrary collisionality regime.
	This formulas are used when we calculate bootstrap current and
	  neoclassical plasma resistivity.

	The GLF23 model for Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) and Trapped
          Electron Mode (TEM) modes is added. 
	This model calculates anomalous transport coefficients and includes
	  the effect of magnetic shear and Shafranov shift stabilization
	  in addition to ExB rotational shear stabilization.
	I think this model was built in TR successfully, but it doesn't work
	  well. The cause of this is not apparently understood.
	We can select the two way of use, one is a normal version and 
	  the other is the version called diffusion-convection method.
 	  They say that this method makes numerical instabilities 
	  greatly depressed, however it also did not work well.

	TR can calculate neutral particle transport.
	The representations of collisional cross-sections are not understood
	  well, especially in terms of the use of a maxwell distribution 
	  function.
	I produced sole use ionization subroutine for neutral transport.
