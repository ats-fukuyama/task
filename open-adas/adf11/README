Installation of OPEN-ADAS data files and program files

   Since the OPEN-ADAS data files and program files 
   cannot be included in distribution, they have to be 
   installed separately from the OPEN-ADAS depository.

1. download xxdata_11.tar.gz in this directory
2. expand the tar.gz file
       tar xvzf xxdata_11.tar.gz
       program files 
3. download data files in this directory
       e.g. adf11/acd50/acd50_w.dat
4. list data files in adf11-lib/ADF11-FILE-LIST
       see ADF11-FILE-LIST.example
